# Starter Code: Robust Server Structure

This project provides a robust foundation for building scalable Express.js applications. It serves as a starter codebase for Thinkful students or developers to learn and implement clean, organized server structures with a focus on scalability and ease of maintenance.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher recommended)
- npm (v6 or higher)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository using the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/starter-robust-server-structure-paste.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd starter-robust-server-structure-paste
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`. You should see a "Not found: /" message, indicating the server is running.

## API Documentation

This project will include various API endpoints, which you can define in the `src/routes` directory. For now, the server returns "Not found" for all routes. As you build the application, make sure to document each route using tools like Postman or Swagger.
